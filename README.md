# Bilai PnP Gui

Forget web based control panel for Bilai (Banglalion) devices.

```
This is a fun project. I have no affiliation/contract with Banglalion Communications Ltd. Use at your own risk.
```

This app logs in to web based control panel using HttpRequest, fetches device status data, parses them and shows as desktop application.
